He turned the problem over and over in his mind, and finally thought out a &quot;brilliant scheme&quot;.</p>        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lai Junchen had a sumptuous feast prepared,and invited Zhou Xing to his home. The two of them urged each other to drink,and they talked while drinking.After the wine had gone round three times,I often come across prisoners who stubbournly refuse to admit they are guilty.I wonder if you have any effective measures.&quot; Hearing this,Zhou Xing said,&quot;Get a big vat,scorch it hot with charcoal fire all around,and then let the prisoner come into the vat.Will the prisoner fail to make a comfession of his crime?&quot;Hearing this,LaiJunchen nodded his head in approval repeatedly.He then ordered his subordinates to bring a big vat ,and had a charcoal fire lit all around it as Zhou Xing had said.He then turned to Zhou Xing and said,&quot;Someone in the rebellion.The empress has ordered me to deal with the case severely.So I beg your pardon,but would you kindly step into the soldiers in the right phalanx wore black suits of armour,and carried black flags and black bows and arrows.The whole army set out at midnight,and arrived at dawn at a place within a LI's distance of the Jin army.When the day was beginning to break,the soldiers of the Wu army began to berat the drums heavily and their shoutings resounded like rolls of thunder.</p>        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Awakening from their dreams,the solders of the Jin army were almost stupefied by the imposing manner of the three phalanxes of the Wu army.The white phalanx was like a field covered with flowering rush,the red phalanx was like a burning fire,and the black phalanx was simply like a sea too deep to fathom.</p>        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This story comes from Comversations from the States.Later generations often use the set phrase &quot;like fire and flowering rush&quot;to refer to tremendous momentum.</p></blockquote><p>　</p> </div>
