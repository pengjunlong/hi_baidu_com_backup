<div id=content class="content mod-cs-content text-content clearfix"> <p>Commands A command is a program you can run. To run a command, type its name and press Enter.<br />Prompts When you see a prompt, type the name of a command and press Enter. In this book, the $<br />character is used to indicate the prompt.<br />Simple Commands A simple command is a command that you can execute by giving its name at the<br />prompt.<br />Default Behavior The output that is generated when a command runs as a simple command is called the<br />default behavior of that command.<br />Complex Commands A complex command is a command that consists of a command name and a list of<br />arguments.<br />Arguments Arguments are command modifiers that change the behavior of a command.<br />Compound Commands A compound command consists of a list of simple and complex commands<br />separated by the semicolon character ( ;).<br />Command Separators A command separator indicates where one command ends and another begins.<br />The most common command separator is the semicolon character ( ;).<br />Shell The shell provides you with an interface to the UNIX system. It gathers input from you and executes<br />programs based on that input. When a program has finished executing, it displays that program's output.<br />The shell is sometimes called a command interpreter.<br />Words A word is an unbroken set of characters. The shell uses spaces and tabs to separate words.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>Utilities Utilities are programs, such as who and date, that you can run or execute.<br />Commands A command is the name of a program and any arguments you specify to that program to<br />cause its behavior to change. You might see the term command used instead of the term utility for simple<br />commands, where only the program name to execute is given.<br />Kernel The kernel is the heart of the UNIX system. It provides utilities with a means of accessing a<br />machine's hardware. It also handles the scheduling and execution of commands.<br />Uninitialized Shell When a shell is started it is uninitialized. This means that important parameters<br />required by the shell to function correctly are not defined.<br />Shell Initialization After a shell is started it undergoes a phase called initialization to set up some<br />important parameters. This is usually a two step process that involves the shell reading the files<br />/etc/profile and .profile.<br />Interactive Mode In interactive mode the shell reads input from you and executes the commands that you<br />specify. This mode is called interactive because the shell is interacting with a user.<br />Noninteractive Mode In noninteractive mode, the shell does not interact with you; instead it reads<br />commands stored in a file and executes them. When it reaches the end of the file, the shell exits.<br />Shell Script A shell script is a list of commands stored in a file that the shell executes noninteractively.<br />Home Directory Your home directory is the directory in which you start out after you log in.<br />Comments A comment is a statement that is embedded in a shell script but should not be executed by the<br />shell.<br />Man Pages Every version of UNIX comes with an extensive collection of online help pages called man<br />pages (short for manual pages ). The man pages are the authoritative source about your UNIX system.<br />They contain complete information about both the kernel and all the utilities.<br /><br /><p>&nbsp;</p>ls The command that lists the files in a directory.<br />cat The command that views the contents of a file.<br />wc The command that counts the words, lines, and characters in a file.<br />cp The command that copies files.<br />mv The command that renames files.<br />rm The command that removes files.<br />Ordinary File A file on the system that contains data, text, or program instructions.<br />Directories A type of file that stores other files. For users familiar with Windows or Mac OS, UNIX<br />directories are equivalent to folders.<br />Invisible Files or Hidden Files Files whose names start with the . character. By default the ls command<br />does not list these files. You can list them by specifying the -a option to ls.<br /><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> </div>
