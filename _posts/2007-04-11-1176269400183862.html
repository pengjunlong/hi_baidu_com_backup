<div id=content class="content mod-cs-content text-content clearfix"> <p>Tears In Heaven </p>                <p></p>    <p><strong>-------------------------------------------------<br />Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?<br />Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?<br />I must be strong and carry on,<br />'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven.<br /><br />Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?<br />Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?<br />I'll find my way through night and day,<br />'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven.<br /><br />Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees.<br />Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please.<br /><br />Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure,<br />And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven.</strong><br /><br /></p> </div>
