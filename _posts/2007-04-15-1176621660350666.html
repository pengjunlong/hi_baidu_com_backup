<div id=content class="content mod-cs-content text-content clearfix"> <p>Scarborough Fair </p>                <p><em>—— Simon &amp; Garfunkle </em></p>    <p><br /><br /><br /><strong>Are you going to Scarborough Fair?<br />Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme<br />Remember me to one who lives there<br />She once was a true love of mine<br /><br />Tell her to make me a cambric shirt<br />(Oh the sides of a hill in the deep forest green)<br />Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme<br />(Tracing of sparrow on the snow crested brown)<br />Without no seams nor needless work<br />(Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain)<br />Then she'll be a true love of mine<br />(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)<br /><br />Tell her to find me on acre of land<br />(On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves)<br />Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme<br />(Washes the grave with silvery tears)<br />Between the salt water and the sea strand<br />(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)<br />Then she'll be a true love of mine<br /><br />Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather<br />(War bellows blazing in scarlet battalion)<br />Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme<br />(Generals order their soldiers to kill)<br />And gather it all in a bunch of heather<br />(And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten)<br />Then she'll be a true love of mine </strong><br /><br /></p> </div>
