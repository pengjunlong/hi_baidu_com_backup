What am I to do ?<br />I’m standing here alone<br />It doesn’t seem so clear to me<br />What am I supposed to do about this burningheart of mine<br />Oh ! What am I to do ? <br />Or how should I react ?<br />Oh ! tell me please !<br />（独白）<br />The rain was killing the last days of summer<br />You had been killing my last breath of love<br />Since a long time ago ......<br />I still don’t think I’m gonna male it through another love story<br />You took it all away from me<br />And there I stand , I knew I was gonna be the ...<br />The one left behind<br />But still I’m watching the lake vaguely conscious<br />And I knew ----<br />My life is ending <br /><br />Now I’m standing here <br />No one to wipe away my tears<br />No one to keep me warm<br />And no one to walk along with<br />No one to make me feel<br />No one to make me whole<br />Oh !
