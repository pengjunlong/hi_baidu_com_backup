<div id=content class="content mod-cs-content text-content clearfix"> <p>Edgar Frank &quot;Ted&quot; Codd (August 23, 1923 – April 18, 2003) was a British computer scientist who, while working for IBM, invented the relational model for database management, the theoretical basis for relational databases. He made other valuable contributions to computer science, but the relational model, a very influential general theory of data management, remains his most mentioned achievement.<br /><br />Codd's 12 rules are a set of thirteen rules (numbered zero to twelve) proposed by Edgar F. Codd, a pioneer of the relational model for databases, designed to define what is required from a database management system in order for it to be considered relational, i.e., an relational database management system RDBMS.[1][2] They are sometimes jokingly referred to as &quot;Codd's Twelve Commandments&quot;.<br /><br />Codd produced these rules as part of a personal campaign to prevent his vision of the relational database being diluted, as database vendors scrambled in the early 1980s to repackage existing products with a relational veneer. Rule 12 was particularly designed to counter such a positioning. <br /><br />Rule 0: The system must qualify as relational, as a database, and as a management system.<br /><br />    For a system to qualify as a relational database management system (RDBMS), that system must use its relational facilities (exclusively) to manage the database.<br /><br /><b>Rule 1: The information rule:</b><br /><br />    All information in the database is to be represented in one and only one way, namely by values in column positions within rows of tables.<br /><br /><b>Rule 2: The guaranteed access rule:</b><br /><br />    All data must be accessible. This rule is essentially a restatement of the fundamental requirement for primary keys. It says that every individual scalar value in the database must be logically addressable by specifying the name of the containing table, the name of the containing column and the primary key value of the containing row.<br /><br /><b>Rule 3: Systematic treatment of null values:</b><br /><br />    The DBMS must allow each field to remain null (or empty). Specifically, it must support a representation of &quot;missing information and inapplicable information&quot; that is systematic, distinct from all regular values (for example, &quot;distinct from zero or any other number&quot;, in the case of numeric values), and independent of data type. It is also implied that such representations must be manipulated by the DBMS in a systematic way.<br /><br /><b>Rule 4: Active online catalog based on the relational model:</b><br /><br />    The system must support an online, inline, relational catalog that is accessible to authorized users by means of their regular query language. That is, users must be able to access the database's structure (catalog) using the same query language that they use to access the database's data.<br /><br /><b>Rule 5: The comprehensive data sublanguage rule:</b><br /><br />    The system must support at least one relational language that<br /><br />           1. Has a linear syntax<br />           2. Can be used both interactively and within application programs,<br />           3. Supports data definition operations (including view definitions), data manipulation operations (update as well as retrieval), security and integrity constraints, and transaction management operations (begin, commit, and rollback).<br /><br /><b>Rule 6: The view updating rule:</b><br /><br />    All views that are theoretically updatable must be updatable by the system.<br /><br /><b>Rule 7: High-level insert, update, and delete:</b><br /><br />    The system must support set-at-a-time insert, update, and delete operators. This means that data can be retrieved from a relational database in sets constructed of data from multiple rows and/or multiple tables. This rule states that insert, update, and delete operations should be supported for any retrievable set rather than just for a single row in a single table.<br /><br /><b>Rule 8: Physical data independence:</b><br /><br />    Changes to the physical level (how the data is stored, whether in arrays or linked lists etc.) must not require a change to an application based on the structure.<br /><br /><b>Rule 9: Logical data independence:</b><br /><br />    Changes to the logical level (tables, columns, rows, and so on) must not require a change to an application based on the structure. Logical data independence is more difficult to achieve than physical data independence.<br /><b>Rule 10: Integrity independence:</b><br /><br />    Integrity constraints must be specified separately from application programs and stored in the catalog. It must be possible to change such constraints as and when appropriate without unnecessarily affecting existing applications.<br /><br /><b>Rule 11: Distribution independence:</b><br /><br />    The distribution of portions of the database to various locations should be invisible to users of the database. Existing applications should continue to operate successfully :<br /><br />           1. when a distributed version of the DBMS is first introduced; and<br />           2. when existing distributed data are redistributed around the system.<br /><br /><b>Rule 12: The nonsubversion rule:</b><br /><br />    If the system provides a low-level (record-at-a-time) interface, then that interface cannot be used to subvert the system, for example, bypassing a relational security or integrity constraint. <br /><br /><br /><br />原则1基本上是关系数据库的基础定义：<br />一个关系数据库，其中所有对用户可见的数据被严格地组织为数据值的表，且其中所有数据库操作都是在这些表上进行的<br /><br />原则2强调数据的主键的重要性<br /><br />原则3通过NULL表示丢失或不适用的信息<br /><br />原则4要求关系数据库是自描述的，包含一些描述数据库本身结构的系统表<br /><br />原则5要求支持一种特定语言如SQL<br /><br />原则6提到视图处理<br /><br />原则7强调面向集合的性质<br /><br />原则8和原则9将用户或应用程序和数据库的低级实现相隔离<br /><br />原则10说明要支持完整性约束<br /><br />原则11说明数据库语言必须能够操作位于其它计算机系统上的分布式数据<br /><br />原则12阻止进入数据库的“其他路径”<br /><br />In fact, the rules are so strict that all popular so-called &quot;relational&quot; DBMSs fail on many of the criteria.</p> </div>
