<div id=content class="content mod-cs-content text-content clearfix"> <p>River Of Tears </p>                <p><em>——Eric Clapton </em></p>    <p><strong>River of Tears<br /></strong><strong>Eric Clapton<br />Pilgrim (1998)<br />River of Tears<br /><br />It's three miles to the river <br />That would carry me away, <br />And two miles to the dusty street <br />That I saw you on today. <br /><br />It's four miles to my lonely room <br />Where I will hide my face, <br />And about half a mile to the downtown bar <br />That I ran from in disgrace. <br /><br />Lord, how long have I got to keep on running, <br />Seven hours, seven days or seven years? <br />All I know is, since you've been gone <br />I feel like I'm drowning in a river, <br />Drowning in a river of tears. <br />Drowning in a river. <br />Feel like I'm drowning, <br />Drowning in a river. <br /><br />In three more days, I'll leave this town <br />And disappear without a trace. <br />A year from now, maybe settle down <br />Where no one knows my face. <br /><br />I wish that I could hold you <br />One more time to ease the pain, <br />But my time's run out and I got to go, <br />Got to run away again. <br /><br />Still I catch myself thinking, <br />One day I'll find my way back here. <br />You'll save me from drowning, <br />Drowning in a river, <br />Drowning in a river of tears. <br />Drowning in a river. <br />Feels like I'm drowning, <br />Drowning in the river. <br />Lord, how long must this go on? <br /><br />Drowning in a river, <br />Drowning in a river of tears. </strong><br /><br /></p> </div>
