One day in late autumn,when he was ploughing in the field,two groups of people were hunting nearby.As shoutings were rising one after another,scared hares were running desperately.Suddenly,a blind hare dashed itself headlong against the stump of a dead tree in his field and died.</p>        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; That day,he ate his fill.</p>        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; From that day on,he no longer went in for farming again.From morning till night,he stayed by that miraculous stump,waiting for miracles to take place again.</p>        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This story comes from&quot;The Five Vermin&quot;in The Works of Han Feizi.Later generations often use the set phrase&quot;staying by a stump waiting for more hares to come and dash themselves against it&quot;to show grusting to chance and windfalls or dreaming to reap without sowing.It is also used to show adhering to narrow experiences and not being able to be flexible.</p></blockquote><p>　</p> </div>
