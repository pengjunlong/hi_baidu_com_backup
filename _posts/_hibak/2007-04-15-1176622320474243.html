<div id=content class="content mod-cs-content text-content clearfix"> <p>Spiderwebs </p>                <p><em>——No Doubt </em></p>    <p><strong>《Spiderwebs》<br /><br /></strong><strong>Sung By &quot;No Doubt&quot;<br /><br /><br />You think that we connect<br />That the chemistry's correct<br />Your words walk right through my ears<br />Presuming I like what I hear<br /><br />And I'm stuck in the web<br />You're spinning<br />You've got me for your prey...<br /><br />Sorry, I'm not home right now<br />I'm walking into spiderwebs<br />So leave a message<br />And I'll call you back<br />A likely story, but leave a message<br />And I'll call you back<br /><br />You take advantage of what's mine<br />You're taking up my time<br />Don't have the courage inside me<br />To tell you please just let me be<br /><br />Communication, telephonic invasion<br />I'm planning my escape...<br /><br />(CHORUS)<br /><br />And it's all your fault<br />I screen my phone calls<br />No matter who calls<br />I gotta screen my phone calls<br /><br />Now it's gone too deep<br />You wake me in my sleep<br />My dreams become nightmares<br />'Cause you're ringing in my ears<br /><br /><br /><br />The End.</strong><br /><br /></p> </div>
