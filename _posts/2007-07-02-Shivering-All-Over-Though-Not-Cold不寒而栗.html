After taking up the official post ,he did very well in managing the official business. He Was courageous and resolute in bandling cases,and punished according to law anybody who violated the law ,no matter whether he was a despotic gentleman who was rich and powerful or was one of the common people .Once the son of Prince Xiucheng violated the law . Prince Xiucheng was the son of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; daughter of the mother of the emperor. YiZong handled the case impartially,for which he was thought of highly by the emperor and was transferred to be the commander of the armed forces in the Henei Prefecture.As soon as he took office ,he had all the members of a wealthy and influential family that had brought calamities to the people there executed. For a while , the&nbsp;&nbsp; public order and the general mood of society in the Henei Prefectures were greatly improved.If someone should lose something on the road through carelessness,nobody would pick it up and take it as his own. When YiZong was transferred to be the prefect of the Nanyang Prefecture,NingCheng,a despotic landlord who stopped at nothing in doing evil,wsa living there,In order to ingratiate himself with YiZong,Ning Cheng pretended to be very modest and courteous every time he met Yi Zong and saw him off. But Yi Zong had heard of the evil conducts of Ning Zong and saw him off. But Yi Zong had heard of the evil conducts of Ning Cheng already and ,soon after he took office in Nanyang,he made investigations.It did not take much time for him to find out Ning cheng's crimes and had him put in prison.Later ,Emperor Wudi of the Han Dynasty appointed YiZong the prefect of the Dingxiang Prefecture .At that time, the publica order in Dingxiang was very chaotic.When he took office there, there were 200 convicts in prison who had committed felonies had no implements of punishment on them.There were also more than 200 persons who offered bribes in order to absolve those serious offenders trom guilt.YiZong treated the matter severely.He arrested all those bribers and punished the bribers and those serious offenders already in prison severely. More than 400 convicts were executed in a bay .From that day on ,whenever the name of YiZong was mentioned.people in Dingxinang would tremble with fear --they would shiver all over though&nbsp;&nbsp; not cold. This story appears in the &quot;Lives of the Merciless Judges and Prison Wardens &quot;in The Historical Records written by Sima Pian. The set phrase &quot;shivering all over though not cold &quot;is used to refer to the state of being extremely afraid.</p></blockquote><p>　</p> </div>
