<div id=content class="content mod-cs-content text-content clearfix"> <p>WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN </p>                <p><em>——Carpenters </em></p>    <p><strong>We've only just begun to live<br />White lace and promises<br /></strong><strong>A kiss for luck and we're on our way<br /></strong><strong>We've only begun<br /><br />Before all the rising sun we fly,<br />So many roads to choose<br />We start our walking and learn to run.<br />And yes! We've just begun.<br /><br />Sharing horizons that are new to us<br />Watching the signs along the way<br />Talking it over just the two of us<br />Working together day to day<br />Together.<br /><br />And when the evening comes we smile<br />So much of life ahead<br />We'll find a place where there's room to grow<br />And yes! We've just begun.<br /><br />Sharing horizons that are new to us<br />Watching the signs along the way<br />Talking it over just the two of us<br />Working together day to day<br />Together.<br />Together.<br /><br />And when the evening comes we smile<br />So much of life ahead<br />We'll find a place where there's room to grow<br />And yes! We've just begun.</strong><br /></p> </div>
