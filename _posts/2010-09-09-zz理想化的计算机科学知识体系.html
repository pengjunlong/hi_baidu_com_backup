Luckily,   the web is full of free resources that can  turn you into a programmer   in no time.</p><p>Since the invention of  the internet, programmers have  been using it  to discuss software  development techniques, publish  tutorials, and  share code samples for  others to learn from and use  online. If you're  curious about how to  become a programmer, you can  get off to a running  start using tons of  great free web-based  tutorials and resources.</p>First Things First: Don't  Get Hung Up on Choosing a Language<p><img width="160" height="109" src="http://hiphotos.baidu.com/pengjunlong/pic/item/1a98ffddcd1520aa76c63893.jpg" />A   common pitfall for beginners  is getting stuck figuring out which   programming language is best to  learn first. There are a lot of   opinions out there, but there's no one  &quot;best&quot; language. Here's the   thing: In the end, language doesn't matter  THAT much. Understanding   data and control structures and design patterns  does matter very much.   Every language—even a simple scripting  language—will have elements  that  you'll use in other languages as well  and will help you learn. In   classes I took to get my degree in Computer  Science, I programmed in   Pascal, Assembly, and C—languages I never  actually got paid to program   in professionally. I taught myself every  language I've used in my   career, reusing concepts I already knew, and  referring to documentation   and books to learn its syntax. So, don't get  hung up on what language   to learn first. Pick the kind of development  you want to do, and just   get started using one that works.</p><p>There are several different  kinds of software development you can do   for various platforms, from  the web to your desktop to your smartphone   to a command line. In this  article, we'll outline some of our favorite   starter tutorials and  resources for teaching yourself how to program  for  each major  platform. We're going to assume you're a savvy user, but  a  newb when  it comes to wrangling code snippets, so we'll keep things  at  the  beginner level. Even just following through a beginner  programming   tutorial, you'll be happy to see how far you can get.</p>Desktop Scripting<p>The  easiest way to try your hand at programming for your Windows or   Mac  desktop is to start with a scripting or macro program like <a href="http://autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a> (for Windows) or <a href="http://www.macosxautomation.com/automator/">Automator</a>  (for  Mac). Right now hardcore coders throughout the Lifehacker   readership are  yelling at their monitors, saying that AHK or   AppleScript are not  &quot;real&quot; programming. That may be true—technically   these types of tools  just do high-level scripting. But for those new to   programming who just  want to get their feet wet, automating actions  on  their desktop, these  free tools are a fantastic way to start—and  you'd  be surprised at how  much you can do with them.</p><p><img width="340" src="http://hiphotos.baidu.com/pengjunlong/pic/item/78bc8aef5ac217aace1b3e93.jpg" class="left image340" />For example, Adam developed the  standalone Windows application we all know and love, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/238306/lifehacker-code-texter-windows">Texter</a>,    using AutoHotkey, so this scripting language is capable of far more    than just small-scale automation projects. To get started with    AutoHotkey, check out Adam's tutorial on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/316589/turn-any-action-into-a-keyboard-shortcut">how  to turn any action into a keyboard shortcut using AutoHotkey</a>.  (Then, check out <a href="http://github.com/adampash/texter">the source  code for Texter</a> to see the innards of a full-fledged AHK-based  Windows application.)</p>Web Development<p>Instead  of being bound to specific programming languages and the look   and  feel of a particular operating system, you can put your killer    application in the browser and run it in the cloud, as a webapp. Welcome    to the wonderful world of web development.</p><p><strong>HTML and CSS:</strong>  The first thing you need to know to  build any  web site is HTML (the  page markup that makes up web pages)  and CSS (the  style information  that makes that markup look pretty).  HTML and CSS are  not true  programming languages—they're just page  structure and style   information. However, you should be able to author  simple HTML and CSS   by hand before you begin building web applications,  because a web page   is the frontend to every webapp. This <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a> is a  good place to start.</p><p><strong>JavaScript:</strong>  Now that you can lay out a static web  page with  HTML and CSS, things  get fun—because it's time to learn  JavaScript.  JavaScript is the  programming language of the web browser,  the magic  that makes dynamic  in-page effects go. JavaScript is also the  stuff of  bookmarklets, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey</a> user scripts, and <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/tutorial/Ajax_for_Beginners">Ajax</a>, so  it's the key to making all sorts of web goodies. <a href="http://w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Start learning JavaScript  here</a>.</p><p><img width="106" height="140" src="http://hiphotos.baidu.com/pengjunlong/pic/item/e96bbdefe01f2d53fdfa3c93.jpg" /><strong>Server-side scripting:</strong>  Once you're good at making things happen inside a web page, you're   going  to need to put some dynamic server action behind it—and for that,    you'll need to move into a server-side scripting language, like PHP,    Python, Perl, or Ruby. For example, to make a web-based contact form    that sends an email somewhere based on what a user entered, a    server-side script is required. Scripting languages like PHP can talk to    a database on your web server as well, so if you want to make a site    where users can log in and store information, that's the way to go.    Excellent web development site <a href="http://webmonkey.com/">Webmonkey</a> is full of tutorials for various web programming languages. See their <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/tutorial/PHP_Tutorial_for_Beginners">PHP  Tutorial for Beginners</a>. When you're ready, check out how to use PHP  to talk to a database in <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/tutorial/PHP_and_MySQL_Tutorial_-_Lesson_1">WebMonkey's  PHP and MySQL tutorial</a>. PHP's online documentation and function  reference is the best on the web. Each entry (like this one on the <a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.strlen.php">strlen function</a>)    includes user comments at the bottom which are often as helpful as  the   documentation itself. (I happen to be partial to PHP, but there  are   plenty of other server-side scripting languages you might decide  to go   with instead.)</p><p><img src="http://hiphotos.baidu.com/pengjunlong/pic/item/0e22baecd9f9e17826979193.jpg" /><strong>Web frameworks:</strong>  Over the years, web developers  have had to solve and resolve the same   problems and rewrite similar code  to build dynamic web sites. To avoid   making everyone reinvent the wheel  for every new web development   project, some programmers have come up  with development frameworks that   do some repetitive work for you. The  popular <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>  framework,  for example, takes the Ruby programming language and offers   a  web-specific structure for getting common web application tasks   done. In  fact, Adam used Rails to build his first serious (and   impressive!) web  application, <a href="http://mixtape.me/">MixTape.me</a>. Here's <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5336113/how-to-build-a-web-site-from-scratch-with-no-experience">his  take on how to build a web site from scratch with no experience</a>.  Other popular web development frameworks include <a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> (for PHP programmers), <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> (for Python  programmers), and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> (for  JavaScript).</p><p><strong>Web APIs:</strong> An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API  (Application programming interface)</a>  is a programmatic way for  different pieces of software to talk to one   another. For example, if you  want to put a dynamic map on your web   site, you want to use a Google  Map instead of building your own custom   map. <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/">The Google Maps API</a>  makes  it easy to programmatically include a map in a page with   JavaScript.  Almost every modern web service you know and love has an   API that lets  you include data and widgets from it in your application,   like Twitter,  Facebook, Google Docs, Google Maps, and the list goes   on. Integrating  other webapps into your web application via API's is   the final frontier  of rich web development. Every good, major web   service API offers  thorough documentation and some sort of quick start   guide to try it out  (here's <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/">Twitter's</a>, for  example). Go crazy.</p>Command Line Scripting<p>If  you want to write a program that takes textual or file input and    outputs something useful, the command line is the right place to do it.    While the command line isn't as sexy or good-looking as a webapp or    desktop app, for rapid development of quick scripts that automate    processes, you can't beat it.</p><p>Several scripting languages that  work on a Linux-based web server   also work at the command line, like  Perl, Python, and PHP—so learning   one of those baddies makes you  conversant in two contexts. My path never   took me too far down the  Perl road, but I taught myself Python using   the excellent and free  online book, <em><a href="http://diveintopython.org/">Dive into Python</a></em>.</p><p><img width="500" src="http://hiphotos.baidu.com/pengjunlong/pic/item/51b68716cdfe1f14f3de3293.jpg" class="left image500" /></p><p>If  becoming a Unix ninja is one of your programmer goals, you   absolutely  must get good at shell scripting with bash. Bash is the   command line  scripting language of a *nix environment, and it can do   everything  from help you set up automated backups of your database and   files to  building out a full-fledged application with user interaction.   Without  any experience writing bash scripts beyond a dozen lines, I   wound up  developing a full-on personal to-do list manager in bash, <a href="http://todotxt.com/">Todo.txt CLI</a>.</p>Add-ons<p>Nowadays,  modern webapps and browsers are extensible with with bits   of software  that bolt onto them and add features. Add-on development is   gaining  in popularity as more developers look at existing software,  like   Firefox or WordPress, and think &quot;But if only it could do THIS...&quot;</p><p>You can do a whole lot in any web browser with just a mastery of  HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Bookmarklets, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey</a> user scripts, and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108">Stylish</a>  user styles are created with the same bits of code that make regular   web  pages, so they're worth learning even if you just want to tweak an    existing site with a small snippet of code.</p><p>More advanced  browser add-ons, like Firefox extensions, let you do   more. Developing  Firefox extensions, for example, requires that you're   conversant in  JavaScript and XML (markup that's similar to HTML, but way   more strict  in format). Back in 2007 I ran down <a href="http://lifehacker.com/264490/how-to-build-a-firefox-extension">how  to build a Firefox extension</a>, a skill I picked up after I stumbled  upon a free tutorial.</p><p>Many  free and well-loved web applications offer an extension   framework as  well, like WordPress and MediaWiki. Both of those apps are   written in  PHP, so comfort with PHP is a prerequisite for getting   started. Here's  <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin">how  to write a plug-in for WordPress</a>.   Developers who want to ride the  cutting edge of Google Wave can get   started writing gadgets and bots in  HTML, JavaScript, Java, and Python.   I wrote my first Wave bot following  this <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/wave/extensions/robots/python-tutorial.html">quick  start tutorial in one afternoon</a>.</p>Web Development for the  Desktop<p>The  best part about getting started programming in one context is   when  you can take those skills and apply them elsewhere. Learning web    development first is a great way to start because now there are ways to    put those skills to work on desktop applications, too. For example, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/ajax/getting_started.html">Adobe  AIR</a>  is a cross-platform run-time environment that lets you build  your app   once and release it to run on the desktop for every operating  system   AIR runs on. AIR apps are written in HTML, Flash, or Flex, so it  lets   you apply your web development skills in a desktop context. AIR is a    great option for deploying desktop apps like one of our <a href="http://lifehacker.com/396393/top-10-apps-worth-installing-adobe-air-for">top  10 apps worth installing Adobe AIR for</a>.</p>Mobile App Development<p>Mobile  applications like the ones you run on your iPhone or Android    smartphone are all the rage right now, so you may have dreams of    striking it rich in the iTunes App Store with the next killer app.    However, for the new coder, diving headfirst into mobile development can    be a rough learning curve, since it requires comfort with advanced    programming languages like Java and Objective C. However, it's worth    checking out what iPhone and Android development looks like. Check out <a href="http://www.cimgf.com/2008/10/01/cocoa-touch-tutorial-iphone-application-example/">this  simple iPhone application development example</a> to get a taste of  what iPhone developers do. Android apps are written in Java, and here's a  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ObTqIiYfE">friendly video  tutorial of what building a &quot;Hello Android&quot; application workflow looks  like</a>.</p>Patience, Elbow Grease,  Trial and Error<p>Good  coders are a special breed of persistent problem-solvers who are    addicted to the small victories that come along a long path of trial    and error. Learning how to program is very rewarding, but it can also be    a frustrating and solitary experience. If you can, get a buddy to  work   with you along the way. Getting really good at programming, like    anything else, is a matter of sticking with it, trying things out, and    getting experience as you go.</p><p>This article is just one  self-taught programmer's top-of-mind   recommendations for beginners.
