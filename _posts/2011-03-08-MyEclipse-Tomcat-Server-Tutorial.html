Within MyEclipse       an embedded Tomcat 6 server is included to help developers get       up and running immediately with their development work and not       need to scour the net for an application server to install,       download it, install it and configure it. Instead, with MyEclipse       you'll be able to immediately deploy your web project, run       and debug it with no additional configuration.       </p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:45331/help/topic/com.genuitec.myeclipse.doc/html/quickstarts/tomcat/index.html?resultof=%22%74%6f%6d%63%61%74%22%20#top">top</a>      <br />            &nbsp;                                2.       <a name="Suggested">Suggested Audience</a>            <p>       This tutorial is intended for developers who are somewhat       familiar with MyEclipse's Application Server feature set and Java       application servers like Tomcat.&nbsp;      </p>      <p>       To learn more about the topics presented in this tutorial, please       have a look at the links in our       <a href="http://127.0.0.1:45331/help/topic/com.genuitec.myeclipse.doc/html/quickstarts/tomcat/index.html?resultof=%22%74%6f%6d%63%61%74%22%20#Resources" title="Resources">Resources</a> section.
