<div id=content class="content mod-cs-content text-content clearfix"> <p>Top of the world </p>                <p><em>——Carpenters </em></p>    <p><strong>Top of the world<br /><br />Carpenters<br /><br />Such a feelin's comin' over me<br />There is wonder in most everthing I see<br />Not a cloud in the sky got the sun in my eyes<br />and I won't be surprised if it's a dream<br />Everything I want the world to be<br />Is now coming true especially for me<br />and the reason is clear<br />It's because you are here<br />You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen<br /><br />I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation <br />and the only explanation I can find<br />Is the love that I've found<br />Every since you've been around your love <br />Put me at the top of the world<br /><br />Something in the wind has learned my name<br />And it's tellin' me that things are not the same<br />In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze<br />There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me<br />There is only one wish on my mind<br />When this day is through I hope that I will find<br />that tomorrow will be just the same for you and me<br />All I need will be mine if you are here</strong><br /><br /></p> </div>
